>  Replace existing Google Chrome homepage with unlimited links to your favorite pages.

This application will provide you a homepage for quickly accessing your favorite sites. Google Chrome does provide this option but unfortunately it is limited to 10 websites only. Using **Pin It** you can practically store unlimited number of links for quick access.

Set the application as your homepage :)

## Usage

The application is currently deployed on Heroku - [Pin It](https://nodejs-pin-it.herokuapp.com/dashboard)

> **Note** - The app is deployed on a free tier of Heroku and may not be live due to any sudden outages. Raise an [issue](https://github.com/Slashflex/Pin-It/issues) and I'll try my best to get it working again.
